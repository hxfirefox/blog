使用Sonar分析Java项目中的单元测试代码覆盖
======================================

# 概述
It is possible to feed SonarQube with tests execution and code coverage reports.

# 准备工作
The Java Plugin is going to reuse reports and not generate them, so before trying to configure your analysis to import these reports, you need to be sure they are correctly generated and not empty.
- The tests execution reports have to comply to the JUnit XML format.
- The code coverage reports have to be generated by Cobertura, or JaCoCo (details below).

# 用法
You need to give the path of test execution and code coverage reports using the following parameters.

|属性|范围|范例|说明|
|:---|:--|:---|:---|
|sonar.junit.reportsPath|Project-wide|target/surefire-reports|Import tests execution reports (Surefire XML format).Set the property to the path of the directory containing all the XML reports.|
|sonar.jacoco.reportPaths|Project-wide|target/jacoco.exec, target/jacoco-it.exec (default)|Import JaCoCo code coverage reports.Set the property to the path of the JaCoCo .exec reports, merge multiple reports.(if you are using a version of SonarQube prior to 6.2 please use sonar.jacoco.reportPath property)|
